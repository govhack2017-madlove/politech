[motion](http://www.openaustralia.org/senate/?id=2006-06-15.31.2) introduced by Senator [Kerry Nettle](http://publicwhip-rails.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/mp.php?mpn=Kerry_Nettle\u0026mpc=Senate\u0026house=senate) also on behalf of Senators [Joe

Despoja](http://publicwhip-rails.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/mp.php?mpn=Natasha_Stott_Despoja\u0026mpc=Senate\u0026house=senate).\n\nThe motion was: \"That the instrument made by the Governor-General on 13 June 2006 under subsection 35(2) of the [Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Capital_Territory_%28Self-Government%29_Act_1988), disallowing the [Civil Unions Act 2006 (ACT)](http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/a/2006-22/default.asp), be disallowed.\"\n\nThis motion would have disallowed the federal governmentâ€™s intervention in the ACT Civil Unions Act 2006, when the [Federal Executive Council](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Executive_Council_%28Australia%29) told the [Governor-General](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor-General_of_Australia) to disallow the Act.(Read more about the Act and the federal government's intervention [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT_Civil_Unions_Act#Civil_Unions_Bill_2006). )\n\nLiberal Party Senator [Gary Humphries](http://publicwhip-rails.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/mp.php?mpn=Gary_Humphries\u0026mpc=Senate\u0026house=senate) rebelled against his party as he crossed the floor to vote 'aye' with the Opposition.(Read more about what it means to be a rebel in our [FAQ Section](http://publicwhip-rails.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/faq.php#rebelandfree). )\n\n_Background to the motion_\n\nThe Civil Unions Bill 2006 was introduced \"to provide a scheme for two people, regardless of their sex, to enter into a formally recognised union (a civil union) that attracts the same rights and obligations as would attach to married spouses under Territory law.\"(Read more in the explanatory statement that is available [here](http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/es/db_21571/default.asp). ) This bill was passed in the [ACT Legislative Assembly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Capital_Territory_Legislative_Assembly) on 11 May 2006.(Learn more about the passing of the ACT Bill
